 ## ðŸ“‹Objective :

Eliminate the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of manual attendance systems by developing a secure and automatic system that utilizes face recognition technology to accurately track individual presence.

## ðŸ“‹ Summary : 

Face recognition is a computer technology that enables the identification and verification of an individual's identity by analyzing and comparing facial features captured in digital images or videos.  It has emerged as a rapidly growing field of research in computer vision, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence.
In recent years, face recognition has gained increasing attention due to its wide range of applications, including security and surveillance, law enforcement, human-computer interaction, and personal identification.  The technology has proven to be effective in identifying suspects in criminal investigations, tracking individuals in public spaces, and enabling seamless access control to secure facilities. 
This research paper aims to explore the current state of the art in face recognition technology, including its underlying principles, key techniques, and recent advancements.  Additionally, this paper will discuss the ethical and privacy concerns associated with the use of face recognition and the need for responsible development and deployment of this technology. 
 

## Result & Discussion
